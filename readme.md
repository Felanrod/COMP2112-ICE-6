# Essay
One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:

> **No!** Just because bigger companies have websites that don't work without js or css, doesn't mean you should do it too _#fronteers_ _#a11y_ [pic.twitter.com/Na8FGEqMWA](pic.twitter.com/Na8FGEqMWA)

On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

>The Chrome team has been pushing both for offline-first and the app shell architecture, which advocates for a server-rendered “*shell*” that then manages most of the actual app content using JavaScript. This is the way that most progressive web apps are being built these days, including applications designed for folks in developing countries, by folks in developing countries.

## In Conclusion
I believe Nolan Lawson makes a very compelling argument for making websites mostly Javascript, to the point that they may not work if the user doesn't have Javascript. The point of JS is to limit the number of pages that need to be loaded on a site from a server. A server that requires an internet connection. A lot of developing countries don't have reliable internet access, so when a user from a developing country gets access to the internet they can hopefully load all the pages they need. What Nolan is proposing is that thanks to JS, a user can load a page once and get all the scripting information with that "*one page*" load which will allow the "*one page*" to update itself to represent other pages, without the need to pull more information from a server. What the people who oppose this are worried about is that if someone doesn't have JS in their browser they won't be able to load the page at all. Fortunately, most of the browsers in the world are being run on JS capable smart phones. **Yay for Javascript!**
